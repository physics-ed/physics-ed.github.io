					Einstein is pretty simple if you aren‚Äôt working with systems that have acceleration in them. Simple enough that I can explain some of his laws within that constraint. Actually, the difference between special relativity and general relativity is that special relativity assumes no acceleration, while general relativity factors in acceleration. So special relativity is actually less special than general relativity. It just works for the special case that everything in a system is moving at constant velocity. (There also seems to be Doubly special relativity and de Sitter invariant special relativity, but I have no idea what the heck when it comes to those.)<br><br>

The <b>first postulate of special relativity</b> is that the speed of light, <img src="e1.png">m/s, is the same for all <b>inertial reference frames</b>, which are reference frames that move at constant velocity. The <b>second postulate of special relativity</b> is that light moves at <img src="e2.png"> even if emitted from a moving source. And that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not like Newton's or Kepler‚Äôs Law‚Äôs where there‚Äôs a nice round 3 amount of laws. Just these two. There are weird things that happen with Time, Length, and Mass, but it‚Äôs not a part of either of these postulates.<br><br>

Yes, <b>Time dilation</b> happens when an observer observes an object moving at constant velocity. The observer will see the moving object go through time slower than normal, and is calculated with <img src="e3.png"> where <img src="e4.png"> is the time that has passed for the observer, <img src="e5.png"> is the time that has appeared to pass for the object, and <img src="e6.png"> is the velocity of the object relative to the observer. Also, when an object moves, the length of the object appears to contract in length. The length that is contracted is only in the direction of motion and can be calculated with <img src="e7.png"> where <img src="e8.png"> is the object's length when it is stationary relative to the observer and <img src="e9.png"> is the object's length when it is moving at a velocity <img src="e6.png"> relative to the observer. Mass is also affected by the motion of objects, and is greater the faster the object moves: <img src="e10.png"> where <img src="e11.png"> is the object's mass when the object is stationary relative to the observer and <img src="e12.png"> is the object's mass when it is moving at a velocity <img src="e6.png"> relative to the observer.<br><br>

If you can understand these equations, they basically explain why objects can‚Äôt move faster than the speed of light. If an object moved at the speed of light, time would appear to stop for it, it‚Äôs length in it‚Äôs direction of movement would be zero, and it‚Äôs mass would be infinite.
